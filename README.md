4. Try to complete just **one** issue in each branch.

### Pull requests made easy!

To ensure we don't break the code, at least one person should review (and approve) the code *before* we squash and merge.

1. Once you feel done with an issue, Open a `Pull Request` (After you've committed and pushed your changes of course)

2. In your pull request, Add a title, description if needed, and a reviewer.

  *Before you add someone as a reviewer, make sure they don't have too much of a workload.*

3. Click `Create pull request`
